# **Research**

<div>
 My research is centered on using quantum mechanical modelling methods like the Hartree-Fock
 method and the Density Functional Theory method to perform geometry optimizations and to
 predict thermodynamic properties of molecules such as aspirin, mesitylene derivatives,
 dimethyl tartrate, dimethyl phenylflourene, and triptycene derivatives. Stereochemistry
 studies are then performed on the optimized structures by modelling the thermodynamic data
 to predict the deuterium isotope effects of the optimized geometries.

<div>
 The optimized geometries are also used to perform Potential Energy Surface(PES) scans
 on molecules to predict the barrier to rotation of certain groups within the optimized
 geometries. The PES scans provide various energy conformations in which the compound can
 exist, which provides information on the energetics of each of the identified energy conformers.

I also employ the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF) to generate the possible energy conformers
of a molecule, through the Maestro software provided by Schrodinger. The generated conformers are then used to study the energetics of compounds and to give information about the synthetic feasibility of hitherto unsynthesized compounds.
